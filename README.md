# Web-Tech-Coursework
This is my coursework submission for my Year 1 Web Technology module. 

Due to the coursework being a group project, I did not complete all the work myself. I have decided to omit the names of the other 4 members of this project and I have replaced where their names where mentioned with 'XXXXX'. The work which I did myself has been highlighted in the individual report and within the individual video submission. All members of the group contibuted to the powerpoint presentation, not just myself.

I have uploaded a pdf version and a docx version of the weekly logs and individual report file as the gif's within this do not play on the pdf version. 

To begin the game, download the 'code' folder and launch the 'startScreen.html' or alternatively you can play the game using the following link below, although this is not recommended.
